## üé® Customization

### Adding Your Own Cats

1. Add your cat images to the `public` folder
2. Update the `personalCats` array in `App.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const personalCats: CatData[] = [
     {
       id: 'personal-1',
       url: '/your-cat.jpg',
       fact: 'Your custom cat fact here!',
       name: 'Your Cat Name',
       isPersonal: true,
     },
   ];
   ```

### Adding Cat Facts

Update the `catFacts` array with new interesting facts:

```typescript
const catFacts = [
  'Your new cat fact here!',
  // ... existing facts
];
```

### Styling Changes

The app uses Tailwind CSS. Key classes to modify:

- Background: `bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500`
- Cards: `bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-3xl`
- Buttons: Various gradient and solid color combinations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading

- Check that personal cat images are in the `public` folder
- Verify image file names match exactly in the code
- The app includes fallback images for external failures

### Data Not Persisting

- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for storage errors
- The app uses multiple storage fallbacks automatically

### Streak Not Updating

- Streaks only update on new calendar days
- Visit the app on consecutive days to build streaks
- Missing a day resets the streak to 1

_Come back every day for your dose of feline joy!_
